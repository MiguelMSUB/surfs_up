# Surf & Ice cream

## Overview of the project

In this module, we'll use new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on our knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. We'll also write and execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs using Python. 

We'll use and apply:
- SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database. 
- Statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data. 
- Design a Flask application using data.

## Results

1. After writing the queries for June and December the stadistics results were:

2. there is just a slightly difference between June and December for all the metrics included in the stadistics.


## Summary
